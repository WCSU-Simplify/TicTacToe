# TicTacToe Game

At its core, Tic-Tac-Toe is simple: it’s a game where two players take turns marking a grid with their symbols, aiming to align three in a row. This fundamental simplicity is part of its charm, but it also limits replay ability. In the modern gaming era, players seek deeper engagement—games that not only challenge their skills but also provide opportunities for social interaction, customization, and progress tracking. Most existing versions of Tic-Tac-Toe lack these elements, reducing the game to a quick, often trivial, experience that doesn’t hold attention for long.

## Project Overview

Our project is a Tic-tac-toe game featuring customization options designed for Windows 10 & 11. Users will be presented with a classic 3x3 game board where they can play locally with another user on the same machine, or against a computer bot with adjustable difficulties. The game will also feature sound effects, game theme music, instance win tracking, and the ability for users to customize their symbols and backgrounds with uploaded images. The game will also implement match replayability and persistently store saved match replays & users customized themes.
